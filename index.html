		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p>I am currently the senior developer at <a href="http://imagebox.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Imagebox</a>.</p>
		<p>I strive to compose clean, semantic &amp; maintainable code. My absolute favorite thing to do is take a website mockup and turn it into a real/functioning/user-friendly website.</p>
		<p>Outside of programming â€” I enjoy retro video games, good movies/tv shows, being a music geek and spending time with my awesome girlfriend.</p>
